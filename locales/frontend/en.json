In a club you connect with the top experts and you can choose the best contractor or business based on the reputation and answers. As an expert or business you have a great chance to show your expertise, customer care and build reputation by giving top answers. Anyone who makes contributions in a club in the form of valuable questions, answers and comments can earn coins distributed by Addspire or rewarded as a bonus."
